## ðŸ“Œ 1. SQL Queries

### 1.1 Weekday vs Weekend Flight Count
```sql
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN DAY_OF_WEEK IN (6, 7) THEN 'Weekend'
        ELSE 'Weekday'
    END AS Day_Type,
    COUNT(*) AS Total_Flights
FROM flights
GROUP BY Day_Type;
```

### 1.2 Cancelled JetBlue Flights on 1st of Each Month
```sql
SELECT 
    YEAR, MONTH, DAY, AIRLINE, COUNT(*) AS Cancelled_Count
FROM flights
WHERE AIRLINE = 'B6' AND CANCELLED = 1 AND DAY = 1
GROUP BY YEAR, MONTH, DAY, AIRLINE;
```

### 1.3 Airlines with No Delays and Distance 2500â€“3000
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT AIRLINE
FROM flights
WHERE DEPARTURE_DELAY = 0 AND ARRIVAL_DELAY = 0 AND DISTANCE BETWEEN 2500 AND 3000;
```

## ðŸ“Š 2. Excel Formulas

### 2.1 Weekday Labeling
```excel
=IF(OR(WEEKDAY(A2)=1,WEEKDAY(A2)=7), "Weekend", "Weekday")
```

### 2.2 Count Cancelled JetBlue Flights (Pivot Filter: Day=1, Airline=B6)
- Use `COUNTIF` or calculated field in Pivot Table.

## ðŸ“ˆ 3. Power BI DAX Measures

### 3.1 Weekday vs Weekend
```DAX
DayType = IF(WEEKDAY('flights'[DATE], 2) > 5, "Weekend", "Weekday")
```

### 3.2 Total Flights by DayType
```DAX
Total Flights = COUNTROWS('flights')
```

### 3.3 Airlines with No Delay and Distance Range
```DAX
NoDelayAirlines = 
CALCULATETABLE(
    VALUES('flights'[AIRLINE]),
    'flights'[DEPARTURE_DELAY] = 0,
    'flights'[ARRIVAL_DELAY] = 0,
    'flights'[DISTANCE] >= 2500 && 'flights'[DISTANCE] <= 3000
)
```

## ðŸ“‰ 4. Tableau Calculated Fields

### 4.1 Weekday/Weekend
```tableau
IF DATEPART('weekday', [Date]) = 1 OR DATEPART('weekday', [Date]) = 7 THEN "Weekend" ELSE "Weekday" END
```

### 4.2 Cancelled JetBlue Flights
```tableau
IF [Airline] = "JetBlue Airways" AND DAY([Date]) = 1 AND [Cancelled] = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END
```

### 4.3 Airlines with No Delay and Distance Filter
Use Filters:
- `Departure Delay = 0`
- `Arrival Delay = 0`
- `Distance between 2500 and 3000`

---

## ðŸ§  Notes
- Dates in Excel and Tableau must be parsed/converted if stored as separate columns (YEAR, MONTH, DAY).
- Join airline and airport metadata using common keys (IATA codes).
